INTRODUCTION
This assignment was to creat a Biography page about myself containing given requirements from the instructor.  This site contains 3 pages: a about me page, portfolio page and a contact page.  Some photo can be click on from there caption located underneath and it will open the photos on another tab.  I added a sticky footer to the Portfolio page as well.
